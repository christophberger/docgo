# goweave

**Generate docs from code like Literate Programming**

## About

goweave creates an HTML file from a Go source file, rendering comments and
code side-by-side. Comments can use Markdown formatting as accepted by the
MarkdownCommon() method of the BlackFriday library; see below for details.

Goweave is meant to work like "weave" in [Literate Programming]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming). Unlike in Literate Programming,
no "tangle" counterpart is required, as the source document is already a
valid Go source file, ready to be `go install`'ed.

## Use Cases

* Read code and comments side-by-side (if your browser's viewport is wide enough).
* Generate blog articles from a single code file.

## Getting Started

1. Install goweave through go get.

	go get github.com/christophberger/goweave

2. Run goweave on a Go file with comments:

	goweave mycode.go

3. Open the generated mycode.html in a browser.


## Options

* `-install`: Installs resource files into $HOME/.config/goweave.
* `-resdir=<dir>`: Resource directory.(1)
* `-outdir=<dir>`: Output directory. Defaults to the current directory.
* `-csspath=<path>`: Output path for the CSS file. Defaults to the current directory.
* `-bare`: Only generate the body part of the HTML document. (No CSS file references is
  included then, use -inline instead or add the CSS reference manually in your HTML
  header.
* `-inline`: Include the CSS into the HTML file. Does not work with `-bare`.
* `-md`: Generate Markdown output rather than HTML.(2)
* `-intro`: Only process the very first comment (which should be some intro text that
  can be read as-is). Comes handy with -md for generating a README.md.

(1) If -resdir is not given, goweave searches for "goweave/resources" first in the
current dir, then in $HOME/config. If neither succeeds, it automatically installs
the resource files into ./goweave/resources.

(2) If you generate a Markdown document instead of HTML, you need to provide your
own CSS that matches the output of your Markdown renderer.

Also ensure your Markdown renderer is able to process "```go" code fences correctly.

Side-by-side rendering of comments and code does not work in this mode unless you
tweak your CSS and/or your markdown renderer accordingly.


## Notes

### Full-width sections

If a comment is not followed by code but rather by another comment (separated
by an empty line), this comment gets rendered in the center of the document and
without a code column.

This can be useful for creating intro sections or READMEs, or for splitting
long code into separate snippets.


## Origins

goweave is based on the wonderful [docgo](https://github.com/dhconnelly/docgo)
project by Daniel Connelly. Although I shuffled much of the code
around, added new code, removed some, and finally ended up with substantial
changes to the resulting behavior, docgo saved me a lot--a LOT!--of time as
it had all the groundworks already done for me.

docgo in turn is a [Go](http://golang.org) implementation of [Jeremy Ashkenas]
(http://github.com/jashkenas)'s [docco] (http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/),
a literate-programming-style documentation generator.

Comments are processed by [Markdown] (http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown)
using [Russ Ross] (http://github.com/russross)'s [BlackFriday]
(http://github.com/russross/blackfriday) library, and code is
syntax-highlighted using [litebrite](http://dhconnelly.github.com/litebrite),
a Go syntax highlighting library.
